These files are used by your Obsidian Conflict Mod Install.
Deleting them would cause all extra content such as Lost Coast or Counter-Strike Source
to no longer be mounted on mod startup. Basically, the mod would not initialize resources
from games like Counter-Strike Source.
If you accidentally turn on lost coast content in the mod and you don't have it installed,
you can fix the mod not starting by deleting the "lostcoast" file in this folder.

Loveboat overlays 1-7 changed to empty transparent .vtfs

Maps

Removed oc_castledefense due to various content being embedded in the .bsp file, editing it would cause a conflict with the "normal" version.
Players will be able to download it from a server when they are joining one playing the map.

Added some updated mapadds for ep2_oc_broken_escape_02a and 02b to fix a few bugs and make the maps more stable. (http://obsidianconflict.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4001)
